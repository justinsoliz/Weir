=======================

Components:
Reader - main class instantiates others
Hound - fetches RSS on a timer, dispatches events with new counts when the fetch concludes
Database.js - tech-specific database layer, start with pgsql
Console - logs out to a file
Config - key/value store loaded from JSON
Server - HTTP requests and AJAX calls
Stream - Registers routes and passes on to the database
Manos - utility functions for async without importing all of caolan's library

Notes:
 - Add TOTP auth (or display token if none has been set)
 - Add OPML import
 - Add database culling, figure out how to do so safely (don't accept old stories?)
 - Add some options (local-only)
  - security
  - view styles: expanded, list-only, list with first active
  - key remapping or compatibility
  - list length
  - infinite scroll?
  - visual theme colors?
 - Add tags
 - Mark as read on activation
 - scroll should trigger activation in the full view
 - move UI handling into possibly another service?
 - Prevent loading of content until such a time as the item is shown (defer images)
